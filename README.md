# Understanding python imports

## Running modules from terminal or from other module brings different results
This example displays some of python's import behaviour when importing a module in different contexts.
You should understand this and be aware of it to avoid rage when importing with python.

What needs to be understood here is, that a module (.py file) will have access to different imports, depending on wether it is called directly by its path (`python folderA/subfolderA/sa.py`) or if it's called inside another module as an import (inside `start.py` the only line `import folderA.subfolderA.sa`).

To be precise:

In the first case, you will be able to import `sa_sibling` but not `start_sibling`.  
In the second case, you will be able to import `start_sibling` but not `sa_sibling`.

To test this out, just run

```bash
python folderA/subfolderA/sa.py
```
and

```bash
python start.py
```

from this project's root folder and see for yourself.

## Naming your main module inside a package the same as your package can lead to confusion
This example presents how naming your main module inside a package the same as the package name can lead to confusing results.

(setup - python version should be ^3.8)
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

To see the problem yourself first run

```bash
python modules/test_pkg/test_pkg/run_test_pkg.py
```

At first you should get an error

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "modules/test_pkg/test_pkg/run_test_pkg.py", line 1, in <module>
    from test_pkg import test_pkg_function
  File "/<path-to-project>/modules/test_pkg/test_pkg/test_pkg.py", line 1, in <module>
    from test_pkg.other_test_pkg_module import other_function
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'test_pkg.other_test_pkg_module'; 'test_pkg' is not a package
```

So what does that mean? `test_pkg` is not a package? It IS a package!

It seems that `test_pkg` when being imported in line 1 of `test_pkg.py` is the **module** `test_pkg.py` itself. Therefore, `test_pkg` in this import statement is **not** the module named `test_pkg`.

That's why everything works just fine when you rename `modules/test_pkg/test_pkg/test_pkg.py` to anything else and also replace the name inside `modules/test_pkg/test_pkg/__init__py`.

If you now run:

```bash
python modules/test_pkg/test_pkg/run_test_pkg.py
```

you should see

```bash
Test Package Function
```
